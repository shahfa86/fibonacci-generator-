# Overview

This Python script generates a Fibonacci sequence of a given length using an iterative approach. The sequence is stored in a list and printed to the console.


# Code Explanation

The function generate_fibonacci(n) initializes a list with [0, 1] (the first two Fibonacci numbers).

It iterates from 2 to n-1, adding the sum of the last two numbers to the list.

The final sequence is returned and printed.

# Example Output

For n = 20, the output is:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181]
